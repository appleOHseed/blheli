For flashing and configuration, get the latest version of BLHeli Configurator from [here](https://github.com/blheli-configurator/blheli-configurator/releases).
The latest releases of BLHeli\_S are downloadable from within the Configurator, or the hex files can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/betaflight/BLHeli_S/releases).
